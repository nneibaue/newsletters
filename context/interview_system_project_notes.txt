Project Notes: Interview Data System for Organizational Insights
*generated by GPT4.1

Background & Motivation
- The goal is to create a system that enables organizations to capture, store, and analyze interviews with employees or colleagues.
- The system should help surface insights, trends, and sentiment from across the organization, reducing the need for excessive meetings and manual information gathering.
- The interviews are intended to be both structured and flexible, allowing for a variety of use cases (e.g., peer-to-peer, manager-to-employee, recurring check-ins).
- The system should support agentic workflows, where missing or incomplete data can be flagged and followed up on automatically.

Vision for the Interview Process
- Interviews are conducted with colleagues, either by a human or an agent, and are recorded (audio, video, or text transcript).
- Example questions include:
  - "Why do you love working at the company?"
  - "What’s your biggest win of the past day or week?"
  - "What’s the most important thing you have to get done tomorrow?"
  - "What’s the most frustrating thing that happened in the last day?"
  - "Is there a recurring source of frustration over the last several months?"
- The system should allow for easy iteration on the interview questions to maximize their usefulness and relevance.
- Interviews may be conducted in different contexts (e.g., 1:1 with a manager, peer review, group check-in), and the system should support different templates or models for each.

Data Capture & Structure
- Each interview should be stored as a structured object, not just plain text, to enable downstream analysis and agentic workflows.
- Use Pydantic models to define the schema for interviews, including required and optional fields.
- Metadata to capture includes:
  - Interviewer and interviewee identities
  - Timestamp and context (e.g., recurring check-in, special event)
  - Speaker turns (who said what, when)
  - Transcription (if available)
  - Sentiment or emotion (if available or inferred)
  - Any missing required fields (to enable follow-up)
- The system should be able to distinguish between speakers, ideally automatically (e.g., via transcription metadata), but also allow for manual annotation if needed.

Storage & Analysis
- Interviews should be stored in a way that supports semantic search and analysis, such as a vector database with embeddings.
- The system should support extracting insights across many interviews, such as:
  - Common themes or recurring issues
  - Sentiment trends over time or by team
  - Notable wins or positive stories
  - Suggestions for process or organizational improvements
- The system should enable the generation of reports, charts, and visualizations for management and leadership.
- The data model should be robust enough to support future automation, such as agents that:
  - Synthesize interview content into summaries
  - Identify missing or inconsistent data and prompt for follow-up
  - Suggest new questions or areas of inquiry based on trends

Agentic & Iterative Workflows
- The system should be designed for iteration: questions, models, and workflows can be updated as needs evolve.
- Agents should be able to use the structured data to:
  - Fill in missing information
  - Alert users or admins to gaps
  - Generate structured outputs for downstream systems
- The system should support both manual and automated data entry, and be resilient to incomplete or noisy data.

Future Considerations
- Integration with transcription systems (e.g., Microsoft Teams, Zoom) to automatically capture speaker identity and content.
- Support for different interview types and templates, with customizable required fields.
- Privacy and security: ensure sensitive information is handled appropriately.
- Scalability: design for large numbers of interviews and users.

Next Steps
- Iterate on the interview content/questions to maximize usefulness.
- Define and implement detailed Pydantic data models for interviews, speaker turns, and metadata.
- Design storage and retrieval mechanisms (vector DB, embeddings, metadata indexing).
- Prototype workflows for capturing, storing, and analyzing interviews, including agentic follow-up for missing data.
- Plan for integration with transcription and identity systems for richer metadata capture.

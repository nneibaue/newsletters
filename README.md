# Newsletters

**Newsletters** is a framework for distilling structured information into audience-specific dashboards, reports, code, and communication artifacts.  
It builds a semantic bridge between structured data and human understanding, using agentic workflows and private corpora to customize what matters for every individual or team.

## ✨ Core Concepts

- **Semantic information distillation** — Codify and synthesize important information into structured, audience-tuned outputs.
- **Agentic journalism** — Agents act as journalists, interviewing users to capture what matters most, public or private.
- **Private corpora** — Each user or team can maintain encrypted, local corpora that personalize their communications.
- **Dynamic communication pipelines** — Move between deterministic code and semantic, human-like language — fluidly and intentionally.
- **Enterprise-ready** — Designed for internal adoption and open source use, adaptable to large organizations.

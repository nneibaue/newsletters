# Interview Data System for Organizational Insights - Detailed Vision
*generated by Claude Sonnet 4

## Project Overview

We're building a comprehensive system to capture, structure, and analyze organizational interviews. The goal is to create a "heartbeat" monitoring system for companies that can surface insights, sentiment, and trends without relying on endless meetings or manual information gathering.

## The Problem We're Solving

### Information Silos & Meeting Overload
- Too much information flows through too many meetings across management tiers
- People closer to execution levels often don't know what's happening at the company level
- Critical insights and frustrations get lost in the noise
- No systematic way to track organizational sentiment or recurring issues

### Current State Limitations
- Ad-hoc conversations don't get captured or analyzed
- One-on-ones with managers may not capture honest feedback (people don't always want to share certain things with their direct manager)
- No way to identify patterns across teams or time periods
- Leadership lacks visibility into the actual day-to-day experience of employees

## The Solution: Structured Interview System

### Core Concept
Create a system where colleagues can interview each other (or be interviewed by an AI agent) using structured questions designed to capture:
- Current sentiment and morale
- Recent wins and accomplishments
- Immediate priorities and challenges
- Recurring frustrations and blockers
- Overall organizational health indicators

### Interview Types & Contexts
1. **Peer-to-Peer Interviews**: Colleagues interviewing each other outside the management hierarchy
2. **Manager One-on-Ones**: Traditional manager-employee check-ins with structured capture
3. **Cross-Team Interviews**: Understanding how different teams interact and support each other
4. **Recurring Pulse Checks**: Regular (weekly/monthly) standardized interviews to track trends
5. **Event-Driven Interviews**: Post-project, post-incident, or milestone-focused conversations

## Sample Interview Questions & Framework

### Current State & Sentiment
- "How are you feeling about work right now on a scale of 1-10, and what's driving that feeling?"
- "What's been your biggest win in the past week/day?"
- "What's the most important thing you need to accomplish tomorrow/this week?"
- "What's been the most frustrating thing that happened recently?"

### Systemic Issues & Patterns
- "When you think back over the last several months, is there one source of frustration that keeps coming up again and again?"
- "What's one thing that, if it were fixed, would make your job significantly easier?"
- "Are there any tools, processes, or people that consistently slow you down?"

### Organizational Connection
- "Why do you love working at this company?" (or "What keeps you here?")
- "Do you feel connected to the company's mission and goals?"
- "How well do you understand what other teams are working on?"
- "What's one thing leadership should know about what's happening at your level?"

### Forward-Looking
- "What are you most excited about in the coming weeks/months?"
- "What are you most worried about?"
- "If you could change one thing about how we work as a team/company, what would it be?"

### Relationship & Team Dynamics
- "Who have you been collaborating with most effectively lately?"
- "Are there any relationships or communication patterns that could be improved?"
- "What kind of support do you need that you're not getting?"

## Technical Architecture

### Data Models (Pydantic-based)

#### Core Interview Structure
```python
class Interview:
    id: UUID
    timestamp: datetime
    interviewer: Person
    interviewee: Person
    context: InterviewContext  # (peer, manager, pulse_check, etc.)
    questions: List[QuestionResponse]
    metadata: InterviewMetadata
    transcription: Optional[Transcription]
    sentiment_analysis: Optional[SentimentAnalysis]
    missing_fields: List[str]  # For agentic follow-up
    embeddings: Optional[List[float]]  # For vector search
```

#### Supporting Models
```python
class Person:
    id: UUID
    name: str
    email: str
    team: str
    role: str
    manager: Optional[Person]

class QuestionResponse:
    question_id: str
    question_text: str
    response_text: str
    response_sentiment: Optional[float]
    response_themes: List[str]
    speaker_turns: List[SpeakerTurn]

class SpeakerTurn:
    speaker: Person
    timestamp_offset: float
    text: str
    confidence: Optional[float]

class InterviewMetadata:
    duration_minutes: Optional[float]
    recording_quality: Optional[str]
    transcription_source: Optional[str]  # (teams, zoom, manual, etc.)
    privacy_level: str
    tags: List[str]
```

### Storage Strategy

#### Vector Database for Semantic Search
- Store interview embeddings for semantic similarity search
- Enable queries like "find all interviews mentioning frustration with deployment processes"
- Support cross-interview pattern recognition

#### Structured Database for Metadata
- Store structured fields for efficient filtering and aggregation
- Enable queries like "show sentiment trends for Team X over the last 6 months"
- Support relationship mapping (who interviewed whom, when)

#### Raw Data Storage
- Preserve original recordings/transcriptions for audit and re-analysis
- Support privacy controls and data retention policies

### Agentic Workflows

#### Data Completeness Agents
- Monitor for missing required fields in interview data
- Automatically send follow-up emails or notifications
- Suggest additional questions based on incomplete responses

#### Pattern Recognition Agents
- Identify recurring themes across interviews
- Flag unusual sentiment changes or concerning patterns
- Generate automated alerts for management attention

#### Synthesis Agents
- Create summaries of interview batches
- Generate reports combining quantitative and qualitative insights
- Suggest organizational improvements based on patterns

## Implementation Phases
